== Build(s) structure

=== One or more projects
image::gradle/bg-9.png[background, size=cover]

* One build contains one or more projects
* Build settings are used to
** declare build participants
** configure common elements
* `projects` task to list the projects of a build

=== Build structure
image::gradle/bg-9.png[background, size=cover]

* Handle it like any piece of code
** Do not repeat yourself
** Build abstractions
** In short, apply good development practices
* Think about your future self
** Opening a project should give you the important information
** Too much centralisation can hurt readability

--
* Show convention plugins
* Pseudo navigation (select & shift shift)
* Move toolchain info to it

=== Convention plugins
image::gradle/bg-9.png[background, size=cover]

* Orchestrate applied plugins
* Configure defaults for you, your project, your company
* Inside the project or published

=== `buildSrc` convention
image::gradle/bg-9.png[background, size=cover]

* Content is visible for project configuration
* All projects see all the content of `buildSrc`
* Any change invalidates all projects

=== Composite builds
image::gradle/bg-9.png[background, size=cover]

* Mix independent builds
* One main build and one or more included builds
* Gradle connects all the pieces
* Replaces the use of local publications

=== Build logic in composites
image::gradle/bg-9.png[background, size=cover]

* Same base as regular composites
* The included build contributes ... build logic
* More targeted than `buildSrc`

--
* Migrate out of buildSrc for the init application project
* Illustrate impact of logic changes

=== Mono vs. Multi repository
image::gradle/bg-9.png[background, size=cover]

* Decision that you own
* Gradle is agnostic to that difference
* In both case, you can have multiple builds
* That you assemble as composites
